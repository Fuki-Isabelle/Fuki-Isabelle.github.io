1. A JavaScript Object is one thing that is stored in one variable. It could be given properties that are additional variables stored inside a larger object.
2. The advantage of using objects would be to command a certain item to do an action. The properties given to that object could allow it to do many things. 
The object would be given useful data due to the properties given. It's fundamental to how data is structured and received.
3. I had some struggles with the program. I understand how it works and how the program is implemented. I just didn't know how to change the speed and some
properties in the program. However, I did figure out how it could be implemented but I just didn't have the time.
