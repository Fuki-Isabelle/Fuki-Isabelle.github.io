1. The advantages of using arrays would be to help create many bubbles more efficiently by implementing large data sets by using a small piece
of code. If there were no arrays, that would lead to inefficiency as the programmer would have to continuously add in a new line of code for
every bubble.
2. I used for loops for my algorithm that increased the amount of bubbles each time by starting from 1 bubble to 100 bubbles. The program
checks through each condition (property) for the bubbles. The loop was able to add in all the bubbles with its properties and from the previous
bubble challenge (moving the bubbles and having different sizes, etc). The challenging part was making sure the syntax was consistent and
didn't mess up or else the whole code wouldn't work.
3. As stated before, one struggle I had was with the syntax. At times, if my code wasn't correctly written the whole program would not show
up. For example, if I forget a paranthesis in one of the properties, the program would not show up at all. Also, if I put " bubbles[i] = "
before the for loop then nothing would show up as before. Silly mistakes with the syntax would lead to such a huge problem.
